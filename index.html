I changed the terminologies that didn't resignated with users and replaced them  : ‘Newsroom’ has been re-named ‘Careers and Media’. I also revamped the footer by condensing navigation to keep it clean, this also addresses users insights that the original homepage had an overwhelming amount of optoipns.

            Is the Header navigation easy to use? 

        A moderated, remote, usability study was held on June 10th & June 11th, 2023. I recruited 7 participants. All participants are adults (18+).

                - Having an arrow drop-down icon for the tertiary navigation is not necessary.
                - Spelling errors need to be edited in both mobile and desktop footer navigation.
                - Footer for the mobile navigation has "too much white space" and should be closer to the subscription element.

            <p>The high-fidelity design for the navigation bar removed the unnecessary arrow icon from tertiary navigation
                I kept the underline for the current/hoover tab as 80% of users  positively mentioned it without prompting. 
                In the navigation bar, the initial ‘Careers & Media’ tab was confusing to users. During the usability study user were asked to complete the application to volunteer . My finding was that 60% of users did not understand that the volunteer section would be classified under ‘Careers”. So, further in my iterations i’ve  addressed this issue by changing the terminology to: ‘Join Us’ .

           <p> Through the intial define phase, it was determined that the flow of information was not intuitive for the users. Users also had difficulty understanding what the webpage was for. Through the ideation phase, which included closed card sorting, and user task flows.  I made changes to the flow of information on the navigation bar and footer. For the protoype phase, I constructed a responsive webpage for both desktop and mobile devices with the changes to the nav and footer. I then proceeded to testing my low-fidelity wireframes. The results indictaed improvment for given task flows. A take away from this usability  study included the need to change terminologies that resignate with majority of users. With that information, I created the high-fidelity prototypes, user testing showed an increase in successful task completion with the changed terminologies and navigation links.
